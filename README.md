### Notes on the Project:
I made this project for three reasons: First, the videos in my playlists always got removed for one reason or another and I wanted a way to keep them permanently. Second, because the tools available at the time only allowed a single video to download at a time, which took far too long for large playlists. And third, I wanted to learn a bit of python.
